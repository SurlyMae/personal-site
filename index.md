## Hi, I'm Ashly

I work as a software engineer in beautiful Utah.

I enjoy the EPL; LFC has been my team since 2014 and I've been lucky enough to see them play at Anfield and Selhurst, and in the States.
I spend A LOT of time reading, writing, pursuing goals, and working on my house.
I adore downtown Salt Lake City.
I'm passionate about spending time with my family and finding ways to be less stressed.
