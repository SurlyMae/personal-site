## Hi, I'm Ashly

I work as a software engineer in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah.

I enjoy the EPL; LFC has been my team since 2014 and I've been lucky enough to see them play at Anfield and Selhurst, as well as in America.
I spend A LOT of time setting and pursuing goals.
I (used to?) adore going out downtown for dinner and cocktails.
And sometimes, I write here about whatever is on my mind.
