## Hi, I'm Ashly

I work as a software engineer in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah.

I enjoy the EPL; LFC is my team.
I spend A LOT of time setting and pursuing goals.
I adore going out downtown for dinner and cocktails.

I tutor folks learning how to program, and I'm going to start writing
 about those experiences here.
As of Oct2020, this site is a WIP.
