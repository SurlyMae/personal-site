_Year 41_

It's not that we give up or stop caring how we look, it's just that goddamn we've been doing it for 30 years and we're a little tired of it, y'all. So much wasted time. Time is now weighing heavily. Do we want to spend more fucking time yelling at our hair or sneering at our bellies? No, thank you. I want to spend my time knitting, watching movies, loving my husband and doggos, worrying about my kids, and eating everything delicious in sight.
