Interviewing is a mental challenge, no joke.

The thing is, I don't want to work for anyone.

I'm damn tired of it all.

The getting-to-know-yous. The constant needing to prove how smart one is. The pretending to care about complete strangers. "Oh how was your weekend, do anything fun?" when really I just want to get to work and not listen to inane stories which I will forget in two minutes.

I'm guessing this sounds negative. But I have a right to be negative. The corporate world, the small business owners, the startups, they've all proven to be ran by fools who make stupid goddamn decisions and really shouldn't be in charge of anything. And we have to work 8 hours a day for these motherfuckers just to survive. If that's not bullshit...

I am restless. Aimless. A little bit melancholy. And angry. So, so angry.

Do these feelings come from not having a job? I can't tell.

Every week I look at job ads, I apply, I interview. Every week I find nothing that actually sounds appealing. Or fun. Or even like something I wouldn't fucking hate. I don't understand - I'm generally not like this. I suspect the last time I felt like this was at the end of my previous career. I tried for years to find something different to move into, with no luck, until finally I just tapped out and decided no more of that career for me. Could I really already be there with this career? It's been a measly six years. Yikes.
