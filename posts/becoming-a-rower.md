7/20? (day 1)  
I'm in a mood. I don't know if these moods are good or bad. Sometimes they lead to disaster, other times joy. This time the mood tells me I'd like to try rowing. You know, like in a boat on water. I bought a rowing machine (alias erg) during the nightmare hell of 2020, and my body seems to like it. I've got one of those NordicTrack machines with the big screen where I can pretend I am actually rowing in water, and it makes me think it would be fun to try it in real life. So I find a local rowing club that gives lessons and buy myself a set of them for my upcoming 42nd birthday. BOOM.

8/21 (day ??)  
I journey to a southern suburb of SLC to see a man about a boat. To see Ed about the Echo shell he's picking up to take back west, actually. I'm surprised it was shipped uncovered. It's blue, not the cutest thing, definitely not as cute as in the photos for some reason. An older model, perhaps? It's slick though, and I still like it. I nervously tilt the gunwales to see how heavy 55 pounds might feel spread out over 18 feet, and it doesn't feel too bad, until I pull it completely off the rack and the bow bangs to the rocky ground. I think, yikes, would I really want to manuever this around all the time? Only later do I remember I needed to find the balance of the boat before lifting it. Can I lift it? Yes. Do I want to add even more stress on my body? Not really. I start thinking of kayak dollies on the drive home. 

9/10  
I head to Wyoming tomorrow to check out a boat! I've been emailing back and forth with its owner for a good week or more, and this weekend dear husband is up in Huntsville camping and the kids are in their own lives and the weather is glorious and that means it's time for a SOLO ROAD TRIP. Where I'm going isn't too far from my old stomping grounds in Pinedale, but no I won't be visiting there. I am taking my dad with me, though - my original idea was to take his ashes back to Pinedale but you know what I avoid that place so why put him somewhere I'll never go? So if I find a pretty enough spot tomorrow, shoot maybe that glorious field of yellow flowers is still there between Jackson and Idaho Falls - haven't seen it in 30 years - I'll leave his ashes there and he will be happy because it's beautiful and I will be happy because then the memory of scattering my dad's ashes won't be tainted with the memory of Pinedale.

Anyway, I'm quite excited to go on a 10-hour road trip, ha. I'm super excited to check out the scull and see if it's suitable for me or not. I'm hoping the daughter won't show up to meet me so I can investigate it at my own very slow pace, not forgetting anything. I just know if someone is hanging around watching, I'll get flustered - you know what, no, fuck that, it's time to stop being hampered by that. Business is business and if I'm spending money I'm going to make sure it's what I need, take my time about it, be thorough. (It's wild how often I act as though I don't deserve to take up space.)

The boat comes with a trailer and dolly and oars and northern Wyoming is a much closer trip than Oregon or the east coast so I'm going for it. My goal tomorrow is to see how hard it is to handle the scull by myself. How difficult is it to move the boat from the trailer to the dolly and back? Is it going to make my arm hurt for hours, or days? Am I going to pee myself a little, or a lot from the effort of lifting it? If I am able to handle it and it's in decent shape I don't see why I wouldn't buy it. The trailer is a plus, I wouldn't have to deal with installing a roof rack on the car and I wouldn't have to worry about lifting the scull over my head, in case it's heavy. I'm assuming in the best case scenario I could back that trailer right down a ramp and launch the boat off it in the way we're all familiar with. 

Anywho, that's all tomorrow. Tonight it's pasta, wine, and a book.
