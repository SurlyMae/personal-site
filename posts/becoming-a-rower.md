7/20? (day 1)
I'm in a mood. I don't know if these moods are good or bad. Sometimes they lead to disaster, other times joy. This time the mood tells me I'd like to try rowing. You know, like in a boat on water. I bought a rowing machine (alias erg) during the nightmare hell of 2020, and my body seems to like it. I've got one of those NordicTrack machines with the big screen where I can pretend I am actually rowing in water, and it makes me think it would be fun to try it in real life. So I find a local rowing club that gives lessons and buy myself a set of them for my upcoming 42nd birthday. BOOM.

8/21 (day ??)
I journey to a southern suburb of SLC to see a man about a boat. To see Ed about the Echo shell he's picking up to take back west, actually. I'm surprised it was shipped uncovered. It's blue, not the cutest thing, definitely not as cute as in the photos for some reason. An older model, perhaps? It's slick though, and I still like it. I nervously tilt the gunwales to see how heavy 55 pounds might feel spread out over 18 feet, and it doesn't feel too bad, until I pull it completely off the rack and the bow bangs to the rocky ground. I think, yikes, would I really want to manuever this around all the time? Only later do I remember I needed to find the balance of the boat before lifting it. Can I lift it? Yes. Do I want to add even more stress on my body? Not really. I start thinking of kayak dollies on the drive home.
