title: Fundamentally Confused
---
"I fundamentally don't understand this." This was recently said to me by a
 bootcamp student. They were wondering where all these methods came from
  that they could magically call without first defining them. Although I'm
   sure I had the same despairing thought during my own coding bootcamp
    (completely allowed since I'm a recovering perfectionist), I was
     surprised. Imagine thinking you're expected to have a good grasp of how
      a programming language works after FOUR CLASSES, when you haven't ever
       studied a programming language in your life. That's wild! You're not
        fundamentally confused, you just need time and experience.  
 Picture yourself trying to learn, say, Italian. You've never studied a
  foreign language in your life and so far, you've taken four classes. You
    don't yet understand how sentences should be grammatically structured
     (noun first? conjugated verb where?) and now you're beating yourself up
      for it. Don't do this. Languages can be difficult to learn. Talking
       shit to yourself about how you can't understand something only pumps
        caution and doubt into your brain, and learning brains don't need that.
