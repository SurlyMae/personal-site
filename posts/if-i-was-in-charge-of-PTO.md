PTO in America - what an absolute disaster.  Do we not deserve vacations? Do we not deserve vacations more than one 2-week period a year? Do we not get sick more than a few times a year? Why do employers continue to hold us over the barrel when it comes to PTO?

If I were in charge, I'd give my employees enough PTO to take a 2-week vacation every three months, and yes they would earn it on day one of work. I'd also give them 5 sick days a month, and bereavement leave would be for at least four weeks. None of the PTO would be able to be paid out, and it would not carry over to the next year. PEOPLE DESERVE TO TAKE TIME OFF SO LET THEM. PEOPLE GET SICK MORE THAN FIVE DAYS A YEAR, THIS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. A woman who has shitty menstrual cycles could use three days of sick time EVERY MONTH. ANYTHING LESS THAN FOUR WEEKS OF BEREAVEMENT IS CRUEL; who are these people who think you can get back to a functioning work level that quickly after the loss of a loved one? My god it's got me completely infuriated.
