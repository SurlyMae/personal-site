title: if i was in charge
---

_disclaimer_

Look, I don't really want to be in charge. I spent years of my life trying to be in charge and then actually being in charge, and being in charge takes a ton of energy, and for reasons unbeknownst to you, I have limited energy and do not want to spend it that way anymore. BUT I still have lots of ideas of how I would do things if I were in charge, things I envision myself doing if I could have everything my way, in a different universe perhaps, and I want to write about those things and explore those ideas and so I do. None of my 'I'd do it this way' posts are intended to be taken as implication my current employer does the thing badly - my posts should only be intended as the sometimes ridiculous, sometimes inebriated, always passionate opinions they are, and that's it.
