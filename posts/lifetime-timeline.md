_capturing memories before the MS and/or Alzheimers eats them_

1996
My boyfriend's sister dies. And then his parents divorce, his dad kills himself, he moves in with my family, and my parents divorce. I have what I now believe is my first visible symptom of MS: back and leg problems that keep me bedridden at the age of 17. (Or it was my body responding in a normal non-disease way to huge amounts of stress and change. Who can say?)

2021: summer   
We remodel our house and at times I wonder if our marriage will survive it. D lands his first job in two years, his first job as a developer. I try to take up sculling with a mad passion while also rediscovering a love of reading. I struggle mightily at work as I try to figure out if I'm bored, not capable enough to do the job, or just in the entirely wrong field. My son moves in with us for his senior year of high school and it's absolutely lovely having him around. Every year I love and appreciate my kids more and more, while regretting all the time I wasted not giving them the attention they deserved. I'm still working on knitting my first beanie, a goal from three years ago. Molly and Cozmo are close to death. 

2021: fall  
My daughter gets engaged and we celebrate with steak and champagne.  
Molly dies and it is absolutely terrible. We have a vet come to the house to make that happen, and it's surreal - Dustin and Joni and Cozmo and I sitting on the floor all around Molly's bed, sobbing and petting her while she takes her last breath. After, we bury Molly in my in-laws' backyard, and every time we visit them, we visit Molly too. 
Cozmo blossoms into a new dog and who can blame him? - Molly was definitely his boss and kind of a controlling one, too.
