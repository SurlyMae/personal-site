title: JavaScript thoroughly. JavaScript and repeat. (blog post)
---

This won’t be a ‘thoughts from week 3 of bootcamp’ post, because I have no thoughts left in my head.

There is only JavaScript.

If the thing I’m trying to think about is not JavaScript, my brain is just not interested, thank you very much.

The hour-long journey to and from campus every day has become a blur. Some days I cannot remember if I walked the final two miles or took Trax. Spans of time the length of entire workdays pass without me noticing. A couple of nights ago Dustin came home from work to find me sitting in the dark with my MacBook, not having bothered to turn a single light on during the past 5 hours because hey, not JavaScript. I misplaced my phone four times between heading upstairs for bed and actually getting into bed. One evening I was water-flossing while mulling over my code when my brain developed a solution, and I walked straight to my computer to write the code, accidentally leaving the WaterPik on — full and running.

My brain is only interested in JavaScript even when it’s supposed to be sleeping. I wake up multiple times a night to find it tossing around coding assignments in an infinite loop. I imagine what it must be like for my loved ones right now: They talk to a blank-faced robot about their daily struggles, and when they’re finished the robot comes to life and responds with a bunch of jibberish about callbacks, promises, prototypes, and inheritance. Frequently the robot has a breakdown and cries just like a human would, but don’t be fooled — it’s only crying about JavaScript.

It’s not like I want my brain to be this way. I appreciate its preoccupation with JavaScript, because my goodness, it is fascinating stuff — but damn, a girl would like a break! 10 hours of JS a day should be enough, right? I’d like to have oysters and champagne with Deez without thinking about let, const, and var. I’d like to shower without reminding myself, “Now I’m shampooing my hair, now I’m conditioning my JavaScript…” and 5 minutes later having to repeat the process. I would love to be able to answer questions like, “Do you want roasted peppers on your salad?” or, “Do you want a beer?” with a word besides, “What?”

I really can’t expect anything else of my brain right now with all that’s being thrown at it. The first two weeks of bootcamp were pretty chill compared to the acceleration that’s happening now, and I know our instructor is still holding back. How do people doing this without a support network survive? I’m trying to imagine not having Deezus doing the grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and offspring-wrangling while I’m in bootcamp, and I can’t even. I did all that stuff myself while in college and working full-time, which was incredibly difficult — and this is waaaaay harder than college!

In the meantime, I’m going to go get some JavaScript.
