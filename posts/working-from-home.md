title: Working from home

_I wanted to go back to the office - I really did_

Pre-pandemic, my office was in a beautiful building, it sounds cheesy but a building full of light and happy people and an amazing energy. My cubicle was roomy - no dreaded 'engineer working elbow to elbow with other engineers at a long open table' hell for us - and the people surrounding me were cool and not annoying. The on-site amenities were terrific and my commute was generally 25 minutes, all freeway. Very little to complain about. 

But still.

Being home means all of these things for me:  
+ I can take stretching breaks (great for my MS) without being embarrassed! It's a little weird to do those stretches at my desk in the office, and it's difficult to find a private area there with enough room to do them.
+ When my MS is bad enough that my hands are shaking and it becomes difficult to type quickly, I can hide that at home instead of laying it out there for all of my colleagues to see. Some things are private.
+ My home office is much warmer. At work I need a blanket, gloves, and a space heater, and also it's really freaking hard to do brainwork while cold. 
+ Also? My home office has dogs. And a private bathroom. And a kitchen stocked with things I eat. And a back patio where I can take breaks and watch the birds.
+ As I type these things, it's getting harder to understand why this was ever a discussion in my head in the first place.
