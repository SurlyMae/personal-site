_I wanted to go back to the office - I really did_

Pre-pandemic, my office was in a beautiful building, it sounds cheesy but a building full of light and happy people and an amazing energy. My cubicle was roomy - no dreaded 'engineer working elbow to elbow with other engineers at a long open table' hell for us - and the people surrounding me were cool and not annoying. The on-site amenities were terrific and my commute was generally 25 minutes, all freeway. Very little to complain about.
